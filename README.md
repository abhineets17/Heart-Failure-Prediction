# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year and they mainly exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. In this project, we analyze a dataset containing the medical records of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab - Pakistan) during the months of April - December in 2015. It consists of 105 women and 194 men with their ages range between 40 and 95 years old. All 299 patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction and had previous heart failures. This dataset contains 13 features, which reports clinical, body and lifestyle information of a patient namely Age, Anaemia, High Blood Pressure, Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK), Diabetes, Ejection Fraction, Sex, Platelets, Serum Creatinine, Serum Sodium, Smoking Habit etc
